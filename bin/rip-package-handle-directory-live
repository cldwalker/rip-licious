# Usage: rip-package-handle-directory-live DIRECTORY
#
# Treats a directory path as a package. This package is unique in that
# no upgrade is needed for edits to the source to automatically effect
# the package. However, new files do require an upgrade.
# This is handy for development but requires a patched rip,
# http://github.com/cldwalker/rip/tree/dirlive .
